2. Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack 
- i.e. what was its source of information?

GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyses and process the data from VPC Flow Logs, 
AWS CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3 data event logs, and DNS logs. 

VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from Amazon EC2 network interfaces in your VPC

Data source: VPC flow logs  ( for this attack)
This finding informs that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to SSH services on Linux-based systems. 
This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources.

This finding is generated only through monitoring traffic on port 22. 
If your SSH services are configured to use other ports, this finding is not generated.
