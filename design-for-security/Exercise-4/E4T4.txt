1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
    
    Enabling WAF to protect the web application
    Remove SSH & and enable System Manager

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

    Creating VPC private endpoints would only control the access to S3 bucket within the network but already exposed unauthorized access would not be solved.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
    
    No, the encryption will be enabled only to the newly created objects

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?

    All changes we have made w.r.t. security group to restrict the access will be lost and replaces with original configurations
