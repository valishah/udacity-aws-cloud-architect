1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 
    a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. 
       Regula (Open Policy Agent) - https://github.com/fugue/regula
    b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 
       Clair (https://github.com/quay/clair) 
    c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
       AWS Config: https://aws.amazon.com/config/

2. For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.

   Infrastructure:
    Network exposures: Ingress open to all IP's
    Unauthorized privileged escalations: Policies with full access (InstanceRolePolicy-C3)
    Compliance violations: S3 and EBS not encrypted

   AMI:
    Old libraries and images can have many bugs and security vulnerabilities.
    Potential threats databases:
    - CVE: https://cve.mitre.org/

   Cloud Configuration:
     Unsecured users 
     Not enable MFA for users
     No policy for passwords
     Public access for S3 Buckets
