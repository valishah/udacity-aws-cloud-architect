RTO(Recovery Time Objective) represents how many hours it takes you to return to a working state after a disaster. 
RPO, which is also expressed in hours, represents how much data you could lose when a disaster happens. For example, an RPO of 1 hour means that 
you could lose up to 1 hourâ€™s worth of data when a disaster occurs.


Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
RTO for recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure can vary from minutes to hours. The duration depends on the size of the database and the 
failure and recovery approach required.
The RTO timing requires starting up a new Amazon RDS instance and then applying all changes since the last backup. 


Minimum RTO for a single region outage
RTO for recovery in a cross-region situation should be less than 5 minutes. All you have to do is manually set the replica as the master database.


Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
RPO for recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure is typically 5 minutes (the interval required for copying transaction logs to Amazon S3), but it 
can vary. You can confirm this by calling RDS:describe-db-instances:LatestRestorableTime. This service returns the latest time to which a database can be 
restored with point-in-time restore.
The RPO is typically 5 minutes, but you can find it by calling RDS:describe-db-instances:LatestRestorableTime. This time can vary from 10 minutes to hours, 
depending on the number of logs that need to be applied. It can only be determined by testing because it depends on the size of the database, the number of 
changes made since the last backup, and the workload levels on the database. The RDS backups and transaction logs are stored in Amazon S3, so this recovery 
can occur in any supported Availability Zone in the Region.


Minimum RPO for a single region outage
This will depend on the replication lag. With CloudWatch is posible to monitor this important metric, and to raise an alert if it reaches a level that is 
unacceptably high.
