RTO for single AZ outage should be negligible as AWS takes care of providing the healthy AZ when in outage.



Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for a single region outage can be a bit difficult compared to AZ. Considering the use case of read replica in different region still we needed to take precautions to make the primary region to be healthy which could be potentially 1 Hour.
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)
Total time: 56 minutes


RPO - Recovery Point Objective. 

As we do not have write replicas in other regions outage of both AZ & region would cause data loss
